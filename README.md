# autopkg-recipes

This is a messy scratch space for me to work on recipes. Please don't "autopkg repo-add" this repo. And for the love of god if you do, use overrides.

I'm putting stable recipes over here: https://github.com/peetinc/peetinc-recipes

Which will hopefully move on over to https://github.com/autopkg/peetinc-recipes at some point.
